%MAIN  --  Bouncing Ball Simulator
%UPDATED --  October 18, 2013
%
% This script uses ode45 with events to simulate a ball bouncing over an
% uneven surface.
%

close all; clear; clc;
P = Set_Parameters(); % Get all of the user defined parameters

%% Run the simulation
% The results of the simulation are stored here. Each cell contains a single ode45 output struct
Trajectory = cell(P.maxBounce,1);

% Initialize the loop:
IC = P.initCond;            % State at the start of each trajectory
tNow = 0;                   % Time at the start of each trajectory
tEnd = P.maxTime;           % End simulation at this time
maxBounce = P.maxBounce;    % End simulation if this many bounces
dynFunc = @(t,X) Ball_Dynamics(t,X,P);   % Handle for the dynamics function
TermCond = 'Termination Condition: Max Bounces';  % For display only

% Loop through each section of the trajectory
for bounceNum=1:maxBounce
    % Run the dynamics until bounce or out of time
    Tspan = [tNow,tEnd];
    sol = ode45(dynFunc,Tspan,IC,P.Options); %events defined in Options
    
    % Store the state immediately before the collision
    impactState = sol.y(:,end);
    
    % Solve the collision
    [IC, ballRolling] = impactMap(impactState,P);   % This becomes the new start state
    
    tNow = sol.x(end);  % Grab the last time
    Trajectory{bounceNum}=sol;  % Store the output of ode45
    
    % Check exit condition
    if tEnd <= tNow
        TermCond = 'Termination Condition: Max Time';
        break
    elseif ballRolling
        TermCond = 'Termination Condition: Ball started rolling';
        break
    end

% Remove any extra cells in the trajectory
Trajectory = Trajectory(1:bounceNum);

%% Prepare the data for plotting and animation:
% This section interpolates the solution returned by ode45 to a much finer
% grid that is used for plotting and animation.

% It is typically bad practice to allocate memory by just appending new
% blocks to the arrays. Here it does not cost us too much time, and it
% makes the code a bit easier to read and understand.
timeAll = [];   % Stores the interpolated solution for plotting
stateAll = [];
timeOde = [];   % Stores the original ode45 solution, stitched
stateOde = [];
% Loop through data, interpolating and then stitching:
for i=1:length(Trajectory)
    
    % Figure out where we want to interpolate the data
    dt = P.plotTimeStep;
    tStart = Trajectory{i}.x(1);
    tFinal = Trajectory{i}.x(end);
    time = linspace(tStart,tFinal,round((tFinal-tStart)/dt));
    
    if ~isempty(time)
        % Now use fancy interpolation to create evenly spaced points
        state = deval(Trajectory{i},time);
    else
        disp('Something funny happened - only one grid point in this trajectory section')
        time = Trajectory{i}.x;
        state = Trajectory{i}.y;
    end
    
    % Make sure that the ball didn't pass through the ground and print a
    % warning and suggested fix if it does.
    heightList = EventFunction([],state);
    if min(heightList)<-P.Options.AbsTol
        % Then the ball passed through the ground
        disp('WARNING - the ball passed through the ground!')
        disp('    Suggested fix - reduce the MaxStep size in P.Options by editing Set_Parameters.m')
    end
