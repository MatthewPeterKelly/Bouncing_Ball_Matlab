function [y, slope] = groundHeight(x)
%% [y, slope] = groundHeight(x)
% This function returns the height (y) and slope (Dy) of the ground as a
% function of the horizontal position. An interesting ground profile is
% generated by summing three sine waves. This also makes the derivative
% (slope) easy to compute.

% Parameters for each of the three sine ewaves:
Amp1 = 0.3;
Freq1 = 1;
Phase1 = 1.58;

Amp2 = 0.1;
Freq2 = 6;
Phase2 = 1.9;

Amp3 = 0.2;
Freq3 = 3.7;
Phase3 = 1.58;

% Compute the ground height
y = Amp1*sin(Freq1*x+Phase1)+...
    Amp2*sin(Freq2*x+Phase2)+...
    Amp3*sin(Freq3*x+Phase3);

% Compute the ground slope
slope = Amp1*Freq1*cos(Freq1*x+Phase1)+...
    Amp2*Freq2*cos(Freq2*x+Phase2)+...
    Amp3*Freq3*cos(Freq3*x+Phase3);
